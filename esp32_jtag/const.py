# SAMPLE: Monitoring Normal Device Operation
# The SAMPLE instruction is designed for monitoring the pins of a working device. In this mode, TopJTAG Probe repeatedly takes snapshots of the state of boundary-scan device pins, without interfering with the normal device operation.

# BYPASS: Skip Device
# The BYPASS instruction allows to 'skip' device when you don't care about it. It minimizes device presence in a JTAG chain allowing for faster scan. You don't need to specify a package and in some cases even a BSDL file for the device.
